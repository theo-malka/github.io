# Spotify Data Visualization Project

This project has been developped by **Th√©o Malka-Lacombe**, **Maxime Peter** and **Julien Verdun** within the scope of a data visualization class at Ecole Centrale Lyon.

This repository includes the files required to build a web application with Github Pages and to create a dashboard with chart related to Spotify personal data.

You can try with your own personal data, all the explanations are given in this repository [SpotifyDataVisualizationProject](https://github.com/Julien-Verdun/SpotifyDataVisualizationProject), how to ask Spotify for your data and the Python script required to process the data using Spotify API.
